================================
``sink`` -- Build Data Warehouse
================================

Overview
--------

Sink is a collection of data-focused tools for data generated by and
used in Evergreen builds. It is not a part of evergreen, but a
companion service and tool kit. In particular, Sink focuses on the
"offline" data processing cases, and providing access to data to
support external user interfaces (e.g. cli tools, data visualizations,
etc.)

Build operations generate data, and Evergreen stores most of this data
directly: the outcome of tasks, the outcomes of specific tests,
artifacts produced by builds. There's other data, specific to
particular projects, data that is less naturally structured or less
specifically linked to specific execution events. Additionally, sink
provides a platform to collect and analyze data *about* an evergreen
deployment in the large.

Components
~~~~~~~~~~

Sink has three core components:

- a simple JSON-only REST web service to data storage and access. (See
  the ``rest`` sub-package.)

- a command line tool that provides a REST client for common
  operations, as well as independent data collection and exploration
  tools. (See the ``operations`` sub-package.)

- an offline task processing framework based on `amboy
  <https://github.com/mongodb/amboy/>`_ for application-level data
  aggregation operations. (See the ``units`` sub-package.)

Data Types
~~~~~~~~~~

- a simple log storage system, as a proof of concept. Logs stream from
  the client to the sink application which stores metadata about the
  logs and then saves data to S3. Out of band, jobs can process log
  data.

- MongoDB Core Server internal dependency data which stores data
  produced by the ``scons dagger`` target.

- Cost spending data, which is collected from Evergreen and hosting
  providers' APIs (or static information as needed.)

Use
---

#. Download and compile sink. I prefer something like: ::

     go get github.com/evergreen-ci/sink
     cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/evergreen-ci/sink
     make build
     pushd /usr/local/bin
     ln -s $GOPATH/src/github.com/evergreen-ci/sink/build/sink
     popd

#. Explore the help menus in the ``sink`` binary: ::

     sink --help
     sink cost --help
     sink dagger --help
     sink service --help
     sink client --help
     sink worker --help

#. Enjoy!

Development
-----------

The sink project uses a ``makefile`` to coordinate testing. Use the
following command to build the sink binary: ::

  make build

The artifact is at ``build/sink``. The makefile provides the following
targets:

``test``
   Runs all tests, sequentially, for all packages.

``test-<package>``
   Runs all tests for a specific package

``race``, ``race-<package>``
   As with their ``test`` counterpart, these targets run tests with
   the race detector enabled.

``lint``, ``lint-<package>``
   Installs and runs the ``gometaliter`` with appropriate settings to
   lint the project.
